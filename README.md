# Project 2: Instanews

- The project is designed to build a one page responsive website that allows users to filter top news using New York Times API.

- Website is designed with 3 optimization size: mobile, min-width: 600px, and min-width: 1000px

## Key Learning

- Learned to use SCSS to style layout more efficiently, and combine mixins, variables, reset and main sheet.

- Retrieve data from NYT API using ajax "GET" method and the use of jQuery and javaScript to append articles to the website.

- My personal understanding of the languages used are improving as I practice more with the projects.
